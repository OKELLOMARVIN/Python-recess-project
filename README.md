Our area of interest is road traffic accidents. And with in the repository, there's the data sets. 
The major inspiration for this project is the increased death rate due to road 
traffic accidents. We are to analyse data in order to come up with insights to help us answer 
various questions concerning accidents. And find out the chance of surviving death when an accident occurs.
